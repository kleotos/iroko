          <h1 style="text-align: center;">Below are the Questions and Answers asked by the Correspondent and the answers provided by Dr. Agosu:
          </h1>

          <div>
           
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> So, our guest for today is an award-winning Cardiologist who has helped thousands of Ghanaians permanently reverse their High Blood Pressure without following any strict diet plan or even exercising at all. 
            </p>

            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> Welcome Dr. Agosu, can you quickly enlighten us about who a Cardiologist is? 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Thank you very much for having me on your show. Please, what was the question again? 
            </p>

            <p><b>Correspondent: </b>I mean from your autobiography, You said you are a Cardiologist, So who is a Cardiologist? 
            </p>

            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Oh alright, you see a Cardiologist is simply a medical practitioner who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases and conditions of the heart and blood vessels. High Blood Pressure being one of these. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> There are not so many specialist Cardiologists in Ghana, so why did you decide to go for that when you could have gone for the more popular medical practices. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Hmm, you won't be the first person asking this, and I'm sure you won't be the last too. 
            </p>
            <p>You see, what pushed me to become a Cardiologist was when my father passed away when I was just 14 years old due to hypertension. 
            </p>
            <p>He had battled high blood pressure for years then, and tried several solutions but none worked. 
            </p>
            <p>It would have been less painful if he had suddenly died from a heart attack, but no, his death was a slow and painful one. 
            </p>
            <p>His high blood pressure caused a stroke that paralysed him and rendered him unable to move by himself for the rest of his life, 
            </p>
            <p>I saw my father go from someone who used to play with my sister and I in our compound to someone who was confined to a wheelchair for life. 
            </p>
            <p>This was a really painful sight for me, he sometimes even urinated and defecated on himself if there was no one around to take him to the toilet. 
            </p>
            <p>I was in SS1 when he died. 
            </p>
            <p>Being an art student, from art class I changed to Science class. Hoping to become a Doctor who would stop what happened to my father from happening to a lot of other people in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>I was just a naive young boy then, but I'm glad everything worked out well and as planned. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow, that's one story. So what was the journey like, the journey to being a High Blood Pressure Doctor? 
            </p>
            <p>
             <b>Dr. Agosu:</b>  Eish! Where do you want me to start from? It was obviously challenging, I would be lying if I said it wasn't. 
              </p>
            <p>But when things got really tough for me, I would remind myself why I got into this at first, and that always kept me going. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> I read in your autobiography that at some point in your career, you were offered a scholarship to further your study in the UK, USA, Canada and India at the same time, but you chose India.
            </p>
            <p>A lot of people would consider this as a great miss of opportunity, what made you choose India over all these developed countries where you could have earned more and potentially become even more relevant in your field. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> It is true that I chose India over these top countries. You see, for me, it was never about the money. I chose India because India is a well recognized country when it comes to medicine in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact if you look at all these UK, USA and the likes, you would notice that most of their top medical practitioners are from India. 
            </p>
            <p>So I thought why not just go to the source directly. 
            </p>
            <p>If you do your research well you'll find out that the Indians are the best in the world when it comes to adult health. 
            </p>
            <p>Their older generation live for as long as 90 years to over 100 years in sound health. 
            </p>
            <p>I was curious as to why this was possible, was it that they were not experiencing ailments like high blood pressure or diabetes, common with older adults in other countries?
            </p>
            <p>This curiosity was why I chose India over these other countries.
            </p>
            <p>Thankfully, I was able to find answers to my questions during my years of study and research in India. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> How exactly did you find this permanent cure to High Blood Pressure in India? 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> I was fortunate enough to work under Dr. Viraj an award-winning Doctor who had spent 72 years of his life practicing medicine across several countries in Europe and Asia. 
            </p>
            <p>Our stories were similar, He also lost his father to hypertension at a young age, that was why he started seeking answers. I guess he could relate with my story, that was why he took me under him to learn. 
            </p>
            <p>It was while working under him that I learned that high blood pressure can be completely and permanently reversed by just using mere natural shrubsâ€¦
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> If this is the case and high blood pressure can be permanently reversed by mere natural shrubs, then why are a lot of people still battling with high blood pressure till today? 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> That is where you are mistaken. These herbs are not very common. 
            </p>
            <p>In fact if you are lucky enough to lay your hands on these herbs, you would still need an expert to combine all these herbs for you in the right proportion before you can even think of consuming it. If not, it would be of no good to you. 
            </p>
            <p>But the good news I have is, during my research in India with Dr. Viraj we were able to combine these herbs and produce them in mass, so it can be of benefit to many battling with high blood pressure in Ghana. 
            </p>
            <p><b>I call this solution The Arjuna-Lasuna Formula.</b> This high blood pressure reverser formula has a 97% success rate, and it has helped over 5000 Ghanaians in permanently reversing their high blood pressure in the last 3 years. 
            </p>

            <p><b>Correspondent: What makes</b> this <b>Arjuna-Lasuna </b>Formula <b>different</b> from other remedies or solutions out there? 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Thank you for that question. You see, unlike other solutions out there, The Arjuna-Lasuna Formula treats the root cause of High Blood Pressure. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Let me explain further; there is something you must know, 
            </p>
            <p>contrary to popular opinions, high blood pressure is not caused by stress, consumption of salt and seasoning, being overweight, lack of quality sleep or exercise. 
            </p>
            <p><b>The real cause of High Blood Pressure is</b> blocked and tiny blood vessels known as <b>Impaired Vasoconstriction</b>
            </p>
            <p>Vasoconstriction happens when the blood vessels responsible for moving blood, oxygen and other nutrients round the body become very tiny or blocked.
            </p>
            <p>And how does this happen?
            </p>
            <p>The blood vessels get blocked by toxins we take in everyday from car exhaust, the air we breathe, the liquids we drink and many other sources. 
            </p>
            <p>All these particles come together and block the blood vessels, 
            </p>
            <p>leaving only little space for blood flow and when this happen it causes the blood to flow through the vessels with a lot of pressure (causing high blood pressure) 
            </p>
            <p>What Arjuna-Lasuna does is that it helps dissolve these particles that block the blood vessels and cause high blood pressure. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent: </b>Can you please <b>explain</b> this <b>in simpler terms?</b> 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Ok, let me paint you this picture. 
            </p>
            <p>See your blood vessels as a pipe running with water, if this pipe gets clogged up with dirt and particles, the water in it begins to flow with higher pressure. 
            </p>
            <p>This is the same thing that happens when your blood vessels are blocked by these particlesâ€¦ 
            </p>
            <p>â€¦that gets into your body from the smoke from exhaust, the air we drink and the liquid we consume amongst others. 
            </p>
            <p>The blood in the arteries begin to flow with much pressure causing high blood pressure. 
            </p>

              <img src="./assets/3.jpeg" alt="okobi" />
            </div>


            <p>Now what Arjuna-Lasuna does is that it helps dissolve these particles that block the blood vessels and cause high blood pressure, solving the root cause of the problem
            </p>
            <p>Instead of only treating the symptoms like chest pain, headaches, breathing difficulties like other 'solutions'. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correspondent:</b> I'm sure after all these you've said, a lot of people will be eager to get The Arjuna-Lasuna Formula. 
            </p>
            <p>So how can people who want to get this Arjuna-Lasuna Formula get it? 
            </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Agosu:</b> Okay. So if you're watching this on your TV, you can simply dial any of the numbers showing on your screen to place your order.
